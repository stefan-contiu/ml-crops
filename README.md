# ml-crops
Machine learning experiments for classifying crops from satelite multi-spectral imaginery.

Covers the following aspects:
* pre-processing and constructing training, cross-validation and testing sets.
* applying various classifiers: naive bayes, SVM, neural networks etc.
* analyzing results by confusion matrix, kappa coeficient etc.
* displaying classification results in GIS like software.
* drafting a research paper.
